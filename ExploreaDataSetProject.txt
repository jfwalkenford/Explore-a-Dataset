Explore a DataSet Project:
I chose the White Wine Dataset to explore.

All coding practices came from the lesson plans in Udacity.

Color came from "Price vs Color vs. Clarity"

Univariate Analysis was practiced on "Lesson 4" RmD File

Bivariante Analysis was practiced on "Lesson 5" RMD File

Removed Code

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
whwn.qualities_by_means <- whwn %>%
  group_by(quality) %>%
  summarise(mean_qual_alc = mean(alcohol),
            mean_qual_fixed_acid = mean(fixed.acidity),
            mean_qual_cit_acid = mean(citric.acid),
            mean_qual_vol_acid = mean(volatile.acidity),
            mean_resid_sug = mean(residual.sugar),
            mean_chlorides = mean(chlorides),
            mean_pH = mean(pH),
            n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(quality)

head(whwn.qualities_by_means)
```

This temporary table should provide a more visual consistent view while losing the detail inbetween.
